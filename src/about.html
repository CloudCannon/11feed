	<h2>Welcome to 11feed!</h2>

	<p>
		11feed is an open-source, self-hosted, RSS reader built with the static 
		site generator <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a>. 11feed is built 
		on a foundation of core principles:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>No ads, upsells, or feature bloat</li>
		<li>Encourage the culture of blogging, sharing, and discovery through RSS.</li> 
		<li>See what others are reading and bring that content into your RSS reader.</li>
		<li>Generate a purely static site that can be hosted publicly on any web server.</li>
		<li>Keep features, dependencies, and the implementation to the bare essentials.</li>
		<li>Provide a solid base for others to build on and customize for their own needs.</li>
		<li>Emphasis on security.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Features</h3>
	<p>11feed intentionally doesn't do a lot. It tries to be a really good at the things it does do.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Easy Import</strong> - Import your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML">OPML</a> file from another RSS Reader to get set up easily.</li>
		<li><strong>Easy Export</strong> - Export your feeds as an OPML file for complete data portability.</li>
		<li><strong>Dark mode</strong> - Perfect for those late-night browsing sessions.</li>
		<li><strong>Secure</strong> - All data is rigorously sanitized. Content is securely displayed within a sandboxed iframe.</li>
		<li><strong>Categories</strong> - Keep your feeds organized with categories.</li>
